I’m a passionate engineer and devout lifelong learner.  I believe in challenge as the path to personal growth and business as a platform for change.  I deeply enjoy the analytical and creative challenge of building clean, scalable systems.  Most of my projects at this point are on my employer's private repos.  My current focus is AI and hybrid cloud.  Applications of LLMs such as RAG for global manufacturers and life sciences companies.
