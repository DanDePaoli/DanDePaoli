Iâ€™m a passionate engineer and devout lifelong learner.  I believe in challenge as the path to personal growth and business as a platform for change.  After 8 years of working on the business side of technology startups I decided to transition to software engineering.  I deeply enjoy the analytical and creative challenge of building clean, scalable systems.  Right now I work mostly with Javascript (Node, React, etc) and Python.

You can check out a couple of my recent projects in deployment on my portfolio site: dpao.dev

Iâ€™m currently working as a contract full-stack software engineer.  I am open to new opportunities and would love to connect with you: https://www.linkedin.com/in/danieldepaoli/
