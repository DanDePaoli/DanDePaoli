Iâ€™m a passionate engineer and devout lifelong learner.  I believe in challenge as the path to personal growth and business as a platform for change.  After a successful 8 year stint working in marketing for tech startups I transitioned to software engineering.  I deeply enjoy the analytical and creative challenge of building clean, scalable systems.  Right now I work mostly with Javascript (Node, React, etc) and Python.

Iâ€™m currently working as a contract full-stack software engineer.  I am open to new opportunities and would love to connect with you: https://www.linkedin.com/in/danieldepaoli/
