Iâ€™m a passionate engineer and devout lifelong learner.  After a successful 8 year stint working in marketing for tech startups I shifted my gaze to software engineering.  I deeply enjoy the analytical and creative challenge of building clean, scalable systems.  My favorite languages -right now- are Javascript and Python.

Iâ€™m currently working as a contract MERN software engineer.  I am open to new opportunities and would love to connect with you:  https://www.linkedin.com/in/danieldepaoli/
